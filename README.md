# Truncated-Tracial-Moment-Problem

Contains a mathematical notebook which is used to calculate conditions of positive semidefiniteness for the proof of a theorem in the research paper *THE SINGULAR BIVARIATE QUARTIC TRACIAL MOMENT PROBLEM* (accepted for publication in the journal of Complex Analysis and Operator Theory (https://link.springer.com/journal/11785)). An earlier version of the paper can also be found on arxiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00494).
